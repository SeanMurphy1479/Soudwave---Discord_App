<h1 align=center> Soudwave-Bot </h1>

**Soundwave Bot** is a Discord bot designed to automate role-based permissions for posting on specific days. Each day, the bot assigns permissions to a designated role, allowing only users with that role to post, attach files, send voice messages, and embed links in a specific channel.


<h1 align=center> Features </h2>

- **Role Assignment by Day**: Each day of the week can have a different role assigned to post in the designated channel.
- **Automatic Permission Updates**: The bot automatically updates channel permissions at the start of each day, enabling only the assigned role to post and share content in the configured channel.
- **Command-Based Configuration**: Users with the appropriate permissions can use slash commands to configure the bot and check who can post on a given day.
- **Hourly Permission Check**: The bot checks and updates permissions every hour, ensuring proper role management throughout the day.
